# Solid Motivation - Browser Extension

Solid Motivation is a browser extension available for both Chrome and Firefox. It replaces your new tab page with an ever-increasing counter, showing your age in real-time. As a vivid reminder of time's relentless march, it seeks to inspire you to seize every moment. This extension is powered by Solid.JS and is deeply influenced by maccman's "Motivation" extension.
